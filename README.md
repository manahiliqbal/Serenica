# Serenica
Serenica is an empathetic mental health support chatbot designed to provide a serene, comforting space for users to express their feelings, find solace, and access supportive resources. Utilizing natural language understanding and gentle prompt engineering, Serenica offers compassionate responses and coping suggestions to guide users through challenging moments. While Serenica is not a substitute for professional mental health services, it serves as a safe and accessible companion for those seeking immediate support or grounding strategies. This project aims to bridge the gap between mental health resources and those in need of a calming presence.
